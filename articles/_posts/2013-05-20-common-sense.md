Common sense is an overused and overloaded term that can mean many things. Below I examine some of the different usages and offer some advice on what to do when you encounter this phrase being used by yourself or by someone else.

## Common Sense _(noun):_
> "sound and prudent judgment based on a simple perception of the situation or facts."

> "sound practical judgment that is independent of specialized knowledge, training, or the like; normal native intelligence."

> "good sense and sound judgement in practical matters."

## Conversational Smells
That smell in your fridge might be decaying vegetables in the salad box or it might be the delicious cheese maturing in the door. Similarly a conversational smell is not a guarantee of rotten communication but rather a warning that further investigation is required. Encountering a smell, whether it was my own creation or made by someone else, causes me to try to find a better way to get my point across or to ask some more questions of the other party.

The phrase _common sense_ is a conversational smell. Let's look at some example usages. Sniff, sniff...

## You're Stupid
> "Well I'd have thought that was just common sense."

Well, yes, maybe I am being stupid. I should first see whether I can view my position from their perspective. Maybe I've overlooked something simple and obvious. Maybe my suggestion is impractical or unachievable. In this case I will revisit my assumptions and my position.

Or maybe the architect is assuming that I am cleverer than I am (this happens a lot). Perhaps I am missing some information, knowledge or skill that is so natural to them they assume everyone has it. In this case I will try to tease out the missing bit of shared context. I always end up learning something fundamental about the issue under discussion or what it's like to be an architect.

## I Don't Know
> "...and in that situation you can use your common sense to decide."
> <small><cite title="A software development manager">A software development manager (ok, me). Yesterday.</cite></small>

There are some situations where the course of action _is_ clear and unambiguous. The fact that you're discussing a decision at all means that this is probably not one of those situations.

The use of the phrase in this way often means that the speaker has given up or doesn't know. If I find myself about to make this smell then I will instead try to offer some heuristics or rules of thumb that will help guide the decision. Or admit that I don't know how to offer help in this situation.

## I Feel or Believe
> "My common sense says that we should take this option."
> <small><cite title="A product manager">A product manager. Tomorrow.</cite></small>

In this usage _common sense_ is used as a synonym for intuition or belief. In this situation I find it helpful to be explicit about the core values or assumptions that are causing me to take a particular position.
